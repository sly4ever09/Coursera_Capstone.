    "\n",
    "In this project segmentation and clustering of neighborhoods in the city of Toronto in the province of Ontario, Canada, is presented. Data for this project is outsourced from a geolocation dataset from \"List of postal codes of Canada: M\" in Wikipedia and a cvs-file of Toronto city Geospatial data. The Foursquare API will be used to find the venues on each postal code zone using a radius based on the area cover by each postcode without overlapping between them and a maximum number of venues per postal code of 100. Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means clustering algorithm) is used to group the postal codes based on the venues density (venues/area), and the Folium library is used to visualize the results, neighborhoods and their emerging clusters on a map of Toronto."

I use the Foursquare API to explore and analyze neighborhoods in Toronto City by Venue densities, and convert venue addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. I used the explore function to get the most common venue categories for a single neighborhood in the city of Toronto, Scarborough, and then used this feature to group the neighborhoods in Scarborough into clusters by way of the k-means clustering algorithm. The Folium library is also to visualize the neighborhoods and their emerging clusters."
